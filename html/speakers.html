              APJ Abdul Kalam quoted “Dream is not that which you see while sleeping it is something
              that does not let you sleep” and our next speaker thrives on the same credence. She stepped on an
              unconventional profession path and haven’t receded ever since. The journey from a middle class
              teenage girl to One of India’s Top Food Bloggers hasn’t exactly been a bed of roses. The Voyage was
              pervaded with thorns but she bloomed like a bright and beautiful flower that she is. Self-Doubt, Society
              or even the Pandemic couldn’t cessate her passion for her work. We are more than ecstatic to present
              the woman whose kitchen is no less than Aladin’s Chirag.

              There’s nothing better to introduce our next speaker than to state her own priceless
              words that “No Dream is too big to come true, No Goal too difficult to achieve and No challenge too
              Gigantic to overcome.” The amount of hardwork, passion and dedication it requires to metamorphose
              from a girl with dream to a woman with success is enormous and there’s no dearth of Hard work or
              Passion in any fragment of the body cells of our speaker. Her Resilience, Robust and Focus fueled the
              fire within her to shatter the norms of the gender biased industry of Aviation. When she took off for
              Bengaluru from the San Francisco airport with her all-woman cockpit, she was creating history with
              every minute that she flew.

              Any amount of appreciation or exaltation falls short to portray the determination and grit of
              our First speaker. One can only imagine what a 10 year old girl endures when she wakes up to the fact
              that she cannot ever walk again. A Spinal Cord injury changed her Destiny forever but that did not deter
              her from dreaming big. She dreamt big and achieved bigger. From being India’s first Wheelchair-bound
              Actress to running multiple social media platforms, our speaker is a jack of all trades. She left her job
              in
              the US to come to India and work with children and at-risk Youth. She currently influences more than 7
              lakh lives through her Instagram. Let us hear the voyage of the woman whose feet couldn’t defy her
              from taking steps towards her passion
